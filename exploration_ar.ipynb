    "\n",
    "The purpose of this notebook is to explore the data contained in AusReddit to see if the data you are interested in (e.g. topics, words, etc) are held in the collection.\n",
    "\n",
    "The notebook/s can access:\n",
    "\n",
    "+ N-grams for the entire collection - 1-grams and 3-grams\n",
    "+ Domains/URLs for the entire collection\n",
    "+ Emotions (NRC) for the entire collection\n",

    "### Working with Outputs\n",
    "\n",
    "Most functions in this notebook return **dataframes**. You can display the results by using the `print()` function, or use `.head(n)` and `.tail(n)` to view the top or bottom `n` rows, e.g.:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "print(top_ngrams)\n",
    "top_ngrams.head(10)\n",
    "top_ngrams.tail(5)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Saving DataFrames\n",
    "\n",
    "You can save any dataframe to a file using pandas' built-in methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "top_ngrams.to_csv('output.csv', index=False)    # Save as CSV\n",
    "top_ngrams.to_excel('output.xlsx', index=False) # Save as Excel\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Saving Plots\n",
    "\n",
    "Plots are typically returned as matplotlib or plotly figure objects. To save a plot to a file, use the appropriate method, for example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# For matplotlib figures\n",
    "fig.savefig('output.png')\n",
    "\n",
    "# For plotly figures\n",
    "fig.write_image('output.png')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You may need to install additional packages for saving plotly images (e.g., `kaleido`)."
